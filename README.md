R_text_mining
=============

**Work in progress**.

R project: Build a text-mining corpus from [abstracts][0] of science contributions, 
presented at the AGU Fall Meeting 2012, San Francisco. 
This is a big annual conference for Earth scientists, in particular geophysicists and geologists.

Use R to draw interesting conclusions from a subset of the 23000 abstracts submitted. 



This project will be presented at [EGU][2], the annual [General Assembly 2013][1], a conference in Vienna to happen in April 2013. 
There will be a 15 minute talk about text-mining in R, on beginner level.

For more information about the code, read the [CONFIGURATION_AND_USAGE.md](CONFIGURATION_AND_USAGE.md) file.
To learn even more, please read the documentation in the ["doc"](doc) directory of this repo for an explanation of  *what* the scripts are doing.
