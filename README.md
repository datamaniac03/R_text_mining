**Work in progress**.

R project: perform *text-mining* on  [abstracts][0] of science contributions, 
presented at the AGU Fall Meeting 2012, San Francisco. 
This was a big annual conference for Earth scientists, in particular geophysicists and geologists.

Use R to draw interesting conclusions from a subset of the 23000 abstracts submitted. (These are *not* included with this repository.)

perform *text-mining* on  [abstracts][0] of science contributions, 
presented at the EGU General Assembly 2013, Vienna (see below). 
This is also a big annual conference for Earth scientists, in particular geophysicists and geologists.

Use R to draw interesting conclusions from a subset of the 11000 abstracts submitted. (These are *not* included with this repository.)




This project will be presented at [EGU][2], the annual [General Assembly 2013][1], a conference in Vienna to happen in April 2013. 
There will be a poster about text-mining in R, on beginner level.
